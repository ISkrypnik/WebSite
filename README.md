# Web Site
WebSite is a Java application that should be used as a backend for internet page.

As a task tracker I am using Github Projects. Link to [WebSite page](https://github.com/ISkrypnik/WebSite/projects/1).

## Description
In current iteration Publication entities can be created, read, updated and deleted with help of REST.
Available only for Roles Manager and Admin. Role User can only get list of Publications.
Data stores in local data base.

Swagger can be accessed without authentication at /swagger-ui.html


### Current backend stack:
* Java 11
* Spring Boot 2.2.6
* Gradle
* PostgreSQL
* Lombok
* Swagger2
    

### ToDo with this README
- [ ] Add instruction how to start app with Gradle
- [ ] Add instruction how to get Swagger documented endpoints
- [ ] Describe front part (or not)
